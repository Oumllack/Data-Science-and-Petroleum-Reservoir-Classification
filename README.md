# Petroleum Reservoir Classification: A Comprehensive Machine Learning Approach

## Abstract

This study presents a comprehensive analysis of petroleum reservoir classification using advanced machine learning techniques. We analyze geological characteristics including porosity, permeability, and oil saturation to develop an accurate classification model for reservoir types. Our approach combines traditional geological analysis with modern data science methods to provide actionable insights for reservoir management and extraction optimization.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Data Collection and Preprocessing
The dataset comprises geological measurements from various reservoirs, including:
- Porosity measurements
- Permeability values
- Oil saturation levels
- Geological formation characteristics
- Reservoir pressure data

### 2.2 Feature Engineering
Key features were engineered to enhance model performance:
- Normalized geological parameters
- Derived composite features
- Dimensionality reduction using PCA
- Feature importance analysis

### 2.3 Model Development
